CellML Annotation Tutorial
==========================

This tutorial aims to provide an introduction to the annotation of CellML models. The initial target is the addition of biological annotations to models from the `repository <https://models.physiomeproject.org/>`_ during the 2014/2015 summer, but the tutorial itself will evolve to cover other types of annotation and best practices.

This tutorial would not be possible without the documentation efforts of the `Auckland Bioengineering Institute <http://www.abi.auckland.ac.nz/>`_ and colleagues. Particularly, we make extensive use of the `ABI Tutorials <https://github.com/ABI-Tutorials/>`_ available on `GitHub.com <https://github.com/>`_. The `source for this tutorial <https://github.com/ABI-Tutorials/cellml-annotation/>`_ is also hosted under that organisation.

When interacting directly with :term:`Mercurial`, this tutorial demonstrates how to work with the repository using `TortoiseHg <http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/>`_, which provides a Windows explorer integrated system for working with Mercurial repositories.

.. note::
   Brief mention of the equivalent command line versions of the TortoiseHg
   actions will also be mentioned, so that these ideas can also be used without
   a graphical client, and on Linux or OS X and similar systems. These will be denoted
   by boxes like this.

This tutorial requires you to have:

* A Mercurial client such as `TortoiseHg <http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/>`_ or `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_ installed;
* The :ref:`OpenCOR <OpenCOR-downloadLinks>` CellML modelling environment; and
* Possibly a text editor such as `Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_ or `gedit <http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/>`_.

The main tool used in this tutorial is `OpenCOR <http://opencor.ws>`_. For convenience, documentation for this tool has been included here.
